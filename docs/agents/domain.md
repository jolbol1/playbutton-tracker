# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repository root.
- **`docs/adr/`** for ADRs that touch the area being changed.

If these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This repository uses a single-context layout:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/
│   └── agents/
├── apps/
└── packages/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether the language belongs to the project or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 — but worth reopening because…_
